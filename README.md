## 🛠 Problem Statement

### 📌 Business Challenge:
Investment firms and financial analysts struggle to gain consolidated, data-driven understanding of investor profiles, preferences, and behavioral trends. Questions like:

2. Analyze preferences – asset types, risk appetite, sector interests.
3. Understand behavioral patterns – frequency, channels, peak times.
4. Enable investor segmentation for targeting and personalization.
5. Assist financial advisors with personalized investment strategies.

### 📊 Expected Outcome:
A three-page, interactive Power BI Dashboard that offers a comprehensive understanding of investors. It supports decision-making in customer acquisition, retention, and product alignment.
